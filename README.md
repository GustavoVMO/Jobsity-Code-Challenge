# Jobsity-Code-Challenge

This is a solution using Azure Cloud to ingest the trips CSV file, in a scalable way, saving me an SQL table and with the necessary transformations.

Below is a tutorial on how we can access the solution, for more information on how all the resources were created, please follow the video on youtube.

Step1:
Login to the azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) under the credentials I provided.

Step2: Launch the Databricks Workspace

Step3: Go to the Workflows tab, and run the job I created. The table may or may not exist, as the pipeline execution is overwrite, you can delete the tables first to watch them being created.

Step4: Create a notebook to query the created tables.
